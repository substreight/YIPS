## Simple Summary
Divide any further YFI inflation, allocating 75% to Liquidity Pools and 25% to the Multisig.

## Abstract
* There are currently no funds being allocated to developing and  improving the yearn ecosystem. 
* Further inflation of YFI provides an opportunity to fulfill funding needs.

## Motivation
Using YFI from inflation to fund development is a mechanism to strengthen the yearn ecosystem while aligning contributors. 

**FOR**: Implement YFI inflation, allocating 75% to Liquidity Pools and 25% to the Multisig.

**AGAINST**: No changes.

## Specification

### Overview
* Designate 75% of future YFI emissions to LP rewards contract. 
* Designate 25% of future YFI emissions to Multisig (or DAO if applicable).
* This will stay in place until it is stopped or adjusted.

### Rationale

Some YFI should be reserved to secure and improve the yearn ecosystem while properly incentivizing liquidity pools.Starting with a 75% // 25% split to LPs and Multisig, respectively, allows proper funding for both stakeholders, while retaining flexibility to adjust the distribution if necessary.
